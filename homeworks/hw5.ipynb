The relationship confirms the fact that in the multiple regression model, when the predictors are orthogonal (or uncorrelated), the regression coefficient of one predictor can be understood as if the other predictor doesn't exist. This particular case is a manifestation of the more general result that when predictors are orthogonal, the regression coefficients in a multiple regression model are the same as in separate single predictor regression models.\n",

In our case, since $\\text{cov}(X_1, X_2) = 0$, the predictors are uncorrelated and the relationship holds."

    "\n",
    "1. **Size of the Coefficient**: \n",
    "   - The coefficient for \"male\" is $1.063 \\times 10^4$, which means being male is associated with an increase in earnings of approximately $1.063 \\times 10^4$ units, holding height constant.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Practical Significance**:\n",
    "   - While the coefficient for height is smaller than the coefficient for gender, it's essential to understand the practical implications. If the unit of height is, for instance, inches, then a 10-inch difference in height would be associated with a $10 \\times 646.96 = 6469.6$ unit increase in earnings, which is still less than the gender difference of $1.063 \\times 10^4$.\n",

    "- From a practical standpoint, the gender difference in earnings seems to have a more substantial impact than a one-unit difference in height.\n",

This suggests that, given the model we have, the impact of height on earnings (at least for the specific height of 5.8ft) is not changing the overall gender-based difference in earnings much. In other words, the height predictor, for this specific height value, doesn't seem to significantly alter the difference in predicted earnings between males and females.​"

    "### Part A\n",
    "What would happen if instead of plotting the correlation coefficient, we plotted $SE(\\hat{\\beta}_1)$ as a function of $b$? Would it increase? decrease? neither? Note that both $X_1$ and $X_2$ are standardized, so the distribution of $X_1$ values is not changed when we adjust $b$. In answering this question, you can either give a geometric intuition, or do a calculation. You should check your answer with simulations, but you still need to provide a detailed explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "To understand the behavior of $SE(\\hat{\\beta}_1)$ as a function of $b$, let's first take a closer look at the relationship between $X_1$ and $X_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As $b$ changes, it affects the correlation between $X_1$ and $X_2$, since\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_2 \\mid X_1 \\sim N(b X_1, 1 - b^2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When $b$ is close to 0, $X_1$ and $X_2$ are nearly independent. As $b$ approaches 1 or -1, the two variables become increasingly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when fitting a multiple linear regression model, the standard errors of the coefficients are influenced by the multicollinearity between the predictors. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When predictors are uncorrelated (i.e., orthogonal), the standard errors of the coefficients are minimized.\n",
    "2. As the predictors become more correlated (increased multicollinearity), the standard errors of the coefficients increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a geometric intuition would suggest that as $b$ increases (in magnitude), the correlation between $X_1$ and $X_2$ increases, leading to increased multicollinearity, which in turn should increase $SE(\\hat{\\beta}_1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify this intuition, we can run simulations. Let's simulate the scenario for various $b$ values and plot $SE(\\hat{\\beta}_1)$ as a function of $b$."

As expected, the standard error of $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ increases as the magnitude of $b$ increases, reaching a maximum around $b = \\pm 1$. This is consistent with our geometric intuition: as $b$ increases in magnitude, the correlation between $X_1$ and $X_2$ increases, leading to increased multicollinearity and, consequently, an increase in the standard error of $\\hat{\\beta}_1$.\n",

    "### Part B\n",
    "Is it possible to have large standard errors on all the $\\hat{\\beta}_i$ values (measured relative to the true values of course), but still have a large (meaning close to one) value of $R^2$? If so, for what parameter values does this happen? Run simulation(s) to support your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "Yes, it's possible to have large standard errors on all the $\\hat{\\beta}_i$ values but still have a large $R^2$. The standard errors of the regression coefficients and the $R^2$ value measure different things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The standard errors of the regression coefficients measure the variability of the estimated coefficients around their expected values. Large standard errors can arise due to multicollinearity, small sample size, or high variability in the response variable.\n",
    "2. The $R^2$ value measures the proportion of variance in the response variable that is explained by the predictors. A high $R^2$ means that the model explains a large proportion of the variability in the response variable, regardless of the precision of the individual coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "One scenario where this might happen is when the predictors are highly correlated (multicollinearity). When predictors are highly correlated, it becomes difficult to isolate the effect of any single predictor on the response variable, leading to high standard errors for the coefficients. However, the combined effect of the predictors on the response might still be strong, leading to a high $R^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this, let's run a simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We'll generate data from the model described in the exercise.\n",
    "2. We'll use a high value of $b$ to induce multicollinearity between $X_1$ and $X_2$.\n",
    "3. We'll fit the regression model and examine the standard errors of $\\hat{\\beta}_i$ and the $R^2$ value."
